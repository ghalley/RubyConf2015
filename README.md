Algorithms have consequences on people

Mar IO

Target:
> If we wanted to figure out if someone was pregnant, even it they didn't want us to know, could you do that?

> As long as we don't spook her it works

Shutterfly thinks you had a baby.

Inadvertent Algorithmic cruelty
> Works most of the time, but not all the time

### Be humble
> We cannot intuit inner state, emotions, private subjectivity

Accidental algo run-ins
- Out of the user's control

Tools used to make film, the science of it, are not racially neutral
- optimized for white skin with Shirley cards

>If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot alsoe be intelligent - Alan Turing

Using a black box for decisions is regressive, to fairness.

### Flipping the paradigm

#### Consider Decisions' potential impacts
- Project the likelihood
- minimize negative consequences
- Not unlike the hippocratic oath

#### Be honest and trustworthy
- Build in recourse for a wrong conclusion
- disclosure of limitations

#### Be visionary about countering bias

#### Anticipate diverse ways to screw up

#### Cultivate informed consent

#### Audit outcomes constantly
- track bias in your own black box

#### Commit to data trasnperency and algo transparency

>Do not build without understanding consequences to others
